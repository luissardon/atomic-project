# The Atomic Proyect
Making efforts trying to implement the Atomic Design System around the Frontend Development process.

## The Concept

* http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/

## The Specs

* We need a system that can be handled starting from Html, rather than a js framework like others do.
* A system based on Atomic Components (Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, Pages).
* Components composed of jade, stylus and js(es6).
* That their view can be added through includes/mixins in jade.
* That their styles can be added through imports in stylus.
* That their scripts can be added through imports in js(es6).

## The Idea
